# NOTICE TO PUBLIC:
Please use anything you find in here ethically--meaning if you're taking
the GorillaLogic test figure it out for yourself.

Actually, if you want the job it's probably not a great idea do use what
I've written here, as this is my first time at all of this stuff.


Note that is my first time, outside of a classroom environment, building
anything in a public cloud.

This was done in Bash, because I had to figure out what I was doing as I went.
I would have preferred to use either SaltStack or Terraform, but I didn't have
the time to implement the former, and I don't know terraform at all.


Basic architecture:

* An Amazon t2.micro instance running Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) in a VPC with a /27 
IP range. 

* Does not use an Elastic IP address (I would do that for a "production" 
instance, and associate it with a DNS entry, which was not done)
* Having a LOT of trouble with the application.
* All the work is done in the  CreateVPC.sh script.
